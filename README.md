This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Mailerlite Integration

The EmbeddedForm and CircularLoader components have been added to this application to consume the api/ml/subscribeUser endpoint. This endpoint creates a subscribed list member in Mailerlite.

In order to try out the form, add environment variables for your account to a .env file. You can copy the .env-example file for the specific variable names, or see the descriptions below.

Youâ€™ll also need to set up MAILERLITE_API_KEY and MAILERLITE_NEWSLETTER_GROUP in your Next config file and add the values to your .env file.

### Environment Variables

1. `MAILERLITE_API_KEY`: Mailerlite API key

Instructions to retrieve the Mailerlite API key [are available here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/where-to-find-the-mailerlite-api-key-groupid-and-documentation).

2. `MAILERLITE_NEWSLETTER_GROUP`: Mailchimp newsletter group ID

Instructions to retrieve the Mailerlite group ID [are available here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/where-to-find-the-mailerlite-api-key-groupid-and-documentation).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
